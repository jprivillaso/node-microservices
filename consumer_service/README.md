# Consumer Service

This is a job that runs every 30 seconds. The idea is to simulate a data consumer that will make requests to the Delivery API, asking for the next order to be processed with status unprocessed.

## Run it locally

1. Execute in a unix terminal `make build`
2. Execute in a unix terminal `make run`

That will build and run the containers locally so you can access and run them.
